# INTRODUCTORY BLOCKCHAIN CONCEPTS

## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. (Wikipedia)

### Key terms

  - __Block__: A block is an individual transaction or piece of data that is being stored within the blockchain.

  - __Blockchain__: A blockchain is a continuously growing list (“chain”) of records (“block”), called blocks, which are linked chronologically and secured using cryptography.

  - __Blockchain Network__: The blockchain network and blockchain are terms used interchangeably. They represent the entire blockchain from the structure itself to the network that it is a part of.

  - __Decentralization__: The concept in which participants work together to validate transactions without relying on a central authority.

  - __Participant__: A client that owns a copy of the blockchain and verifies transactions across the network.

## What are Blocks?

Blocks are the building blocks of a blockchain. A block contains transaction data and other important details related to the creation of that block, such as the time when it was created and other unique information.

### Properties of Block:

  - __Timestamp__: The time the block is created determines the location of it on the blockchain.

  - __Transaction Data__: The information to be securely stored in the block.

  - __Hash__: A unique code produced by combining all the contents within the block itself — also known as a digital fingerprint.

  - __Previous Hash__: Each block has a reference to the block prior to its hash. This is what makes the blockchain unique because this link will be broken if a block is tampered with.
